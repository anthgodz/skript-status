WARNING! For this to work, you need a chat plugin such as essentials chat and you NEED the plugin vault, then you need to configure the chat plugin so in chat it includes the player suffix in the message instead of <player> message, if the status is set to something, it should include the suffix in the message, for essentials chat, find line "format: " under EssentialsX chat (it will be in a big # thingy) and change it to "format: <{DISPLAYNAME}> {MESSAGE}" then type "/essentials reload" to reload config
